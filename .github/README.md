# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles. I am just starting to build them up in March of 2017. I am currently running an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) pseudo-server and am using an Apple laptop. I sync the dotfiles with [Dropbox.](https://www.dropbox.com/) I use git for version control and keep non-sensitive dotfiles in [this](https://github.com/shmcgrath/dotfiles) public GitHub repo.

I will update this README with more links, tips, and information as I grow my dotfiles.

## Submodules

This repo has [vim-infolines](https://github.com/shmcgrath/vim-infolines) as a submodule. After cloning a repo with a submodule, the submodules need to be initialized and updated.

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

If the repo containing submodules has already been cloned, update them.

``` bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Command to update a submodule:
``` bash
git submodule update --remote
```

## Dotfile Management with GNU Stow and GitHub

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to manage my dotfiles. This allows me to easily create symlinks on any \*nix-based system I am using. I chose Stow because it is easily and universally available on \*nix machines. I do use Windows boxes, but I don't see myself needing the majority of my dotfiles on those machines. One tool I found when looking for Windows alternatives is [stow-lite](https://github.com/ericsubach/stow-lite) but I have not used it yet. I also chose stow because I would be able to use it to manage config files that are not in ~/. In the future, I can use stow to deploy centralized config files across my system(s). 
 
### GNU Stow and .DS\_Store Files

I ran into a bit of an issue when creating the symlinks on Sierra. I kept getting an error message referencing .DS\_Store files. After some Googling, I found that if you run Stow with an --ignore flag for .DS\_Store, that error will not pop.

``` bash
$ stow -v --ignore ".DS_Store" -t ~/ folder

```

You can also create a [.stow-global-ignore file](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Ignore-Lists) in your home directory and add .DS_Store to that file.


When stowing grub, run as sudo with -Rv flags and --target of /

``` bash
$ sudo stow -Rv -t / grub

```

## My Config Notes:
- Current iTerm colorscheme: base16 tomorrownight dark 256
- When bootstraping a new machine, change the $HOME in .stowrc to the actual home path of the machine
- Make sure to mark stowrc and newsblur-pass as [assume-unchnaged](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index)
- Add .scripts to the windows path
- Link to the [vim desert theme](https://github.com/vim/colorschemes/blob/64b7b26ac5571f39cc00215a65a01379fb70ebd3/colortemplate/desert.colortemplate)
