- Vim Diff
  - to diff two tabs in the current window --> :windo diffthis
  - to end diff mode --> :diffoff!
- Re-Syntax Highlight current buffer --> autocmd BufEnter * :syntax sync fromstart
Vim has a built-in re-formatter for whitespace. Visually select some text and use the = key to re-indent all of it.
- :%s/foo/bar/gc --> Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first
- check GUI Font --> :set guifont?

Show Invisible Characters
Vim’s list feature can be used to reveal hidden characters, such as tabstops and newlines.
- toggle list feature by typing "set: list!"
- help: listchars

Clipboard
- The <C-r>{reg} command lets us paste a register from Insert mode (and it works in commandline mode too!)
" the default register
% the current file name
# the alternate file name
* the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
+ the clipboard contents
/ the last search pattern
: the last command-line
. the last inserted text
- the last small (less than a line) delete

Mark Motions
- go to last change: `.
    - The ` goes to a mark, and . is a "special" mark which is automatically set to the position where the last change was made.
- go back to where the cursor was before you made your last jump: ``
- this is the position where the cursor was the last time when insert mode was stopped: `^
- :help mark-motions

- move between positions in the change list: g; and g,

You can also use ' (apostrophe) instead of ` (backtick)

- increment the next number: Ctrl-A (normal mode)
- decrement the next number: Ctrl-X (normal mode)
- The number can be at the cursor, or to the right of the cursor (on the same line).

- The `. command will bring you to your last change.
The ` goes to a mark, and . is a "special" mark which is automatically set to the position where the last change was made. See :help `. for some more information.
There is also `` which will bring you back to where the cursor was before you made your last jump. See :help `` for more information.
Another useful mark is `^; this is the position where the cursor was the last time when insert mode was stopped. See :help `^.
See :help mark-motions for some more general info about using marks (including some other "special" marks that are automatically set).
You can also use g; and g, to move between position in the change list. See :h g; and :h g
You can also use ' (apostrophe) instead of ` (backtick)

- In normal mode, typing Ctrl-A will increment the next number, and typing Ctrl-X will decrement the next number. The number can be at the cursor, or to the right of the cursor (on the same line). These are the defaults for Vim, although some scripts remap these keys to perform other functions.

: recent versions of MacVim change the working directory globally with `cd`, and locally for the current window with `lcd`
You can reveal the current directory with the command:

:pwd

To change the working directory for the current tab, use the command:

:cd

Note that both :pwd and :cd commands are native to Vim. You can call the equivalent commands for your shell by running :!pwd or :!cd.

Add a ? mark after the setting name and it will show the valu

## Plugins

### [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
- Normally to generate documentation, Vim expects you to run :helptags on each directory with documentation (e.g., :helptags ~/.vim/doc). Provided with pathogen.vim is a :Helptags command that does this on every directory in your 'runtimepath'. If you really want to get crazy, you could even invoke Helptags in your vimrc. I don't like to get crazy.

### [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

### [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
There are some hotkeys provided by vim to switch between the changes in history, like u, <ctrl-r>, g+, g- as well as the :earlier and :later commands.
